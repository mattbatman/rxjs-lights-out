# RXJS LIGHTS OUT

This is intended to serve as a simple example and comparison of a toggle button written using RxJS versus vanilla JavaScript.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo locally, run `npm install`.

Run `npm start` and copy the address served on your command line to a browser to view the application.

## Structure

This application was written twice, once using RxJS in `js/app.js` and once using plain JavaScript in `js/app-vanilla.js`.

## Resources

The basic structure of my RxJS application was taken from [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34533158/create-a-toggle-button-with-rxjs).

I used some functions to add and remove classes from [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/).
